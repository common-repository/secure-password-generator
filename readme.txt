== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any settings? =
No, there are currently no settings. Once activated, you can place the shortcode: [secure_pw_gen][/secure_pw_gen] on any page.

= Why does the shortcode have opening and closing tags if there is no content in between? =
In the future, the plugin will have additional settings and options. Using certain special characters such as "]" within shortcode attributes causes problems, so these will be placed between the opening and closing tags of the shortcode. Using only the bare opening tag with no options will work fine, but it is recommended to use the full shortcode just to be safe and avoid any conflics in future versions.
